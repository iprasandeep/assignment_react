# Admin Dashboard Application

This project utilizes Create React App to bootstrap the Admin Dashboard application.

## Getting Started

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Launches the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload upon changes. Additionally, any lint errors will be visible in the console.

#### `npm test`

Runs the test runner in interactive watch mode. For more details, refer to the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It bundles React in production mode, optimizing performance by minifying the build and including hashes in filenames. The app will be ready for deployment.

For further information on deployment, check the [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) section.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Ejecting cannot be reversed!**

In case you're unsatisfied with the build tool and configurations, `eject` allows complete control. It copies configuration files and dependencies into your project for full customization. However, this operation is irreversible.

You might not need `eject` as the curated feature set suits most small to mid-scale deployments.
